I am an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology, Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland. I do research on auditory cognition and the links between the auditory and emotional systems in humans.

I also did some work in pain psychology. My PhD thesis about predictors of chronic low back pain (in Polish) can be found [here](phd).
